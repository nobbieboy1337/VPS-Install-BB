# How to Install Go 1.22.3 on Ubuntu

Follow these steps to install Go 1.22.3 on Ubuntu.

## 1. Open a Terminal Window
Start by opening a terminal window to execute commands.

## 2. Update Package List and Install Required Dependencies
Make sure your package list is up to date and install required tools like `wget`, `curl`, and `git`:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y wget curl git
```

## 3. Download the Latest Go Release (Go 1.22.3) for Linux
Download the latest Go 1.22.3 release for Linux using the `wget` command:
```bash
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

## 4. Verify the Integrity of the Downloaded File
Download the corresponding SHA256 checksum file and verify the checksum:
```bash
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz.sha256
sha256sum -c go1.22.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz.sha256
```
If the checksums match, it should display:
```
go1.22.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz: OK
```

## 5. Extract the Downloaded Archive to `/usr/local`
Extract the archive to the `/usr/local` directory:
```bash
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

## 6. Add Go Binary to System's PATH Environment Variable
Add the Go binary directory to your system's `PATH` environment variable by editing the `~/.bashrc` file:
```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Add the following lines at the end of the file:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

Save the file and exit the editor by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

## 7. Reload `.bashrc` File to Apply Changes
Reload the `.bashrc` file to apply the changes:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## 8. Verify the Go Installation
Verify that Go is installed correctly by typing the following command:
```bash
go version
```
If the installation was successful, it should display:
```
go version go1.22.3 linux/amd64
```

## Additional Tips

- **Setting GOPATH (Optional)**
  If you want to set a different `GOPATH` than `$HOME/go`, you can specify any other directory. For example:
  ```bash
  echo "export GOPATH=/custom/go/path" >> ~/.bashrc
  ```

- **Start Creating Go Projects**
  With Go installed, you can now start creating and running Go programs in your workspace directory (typically `~/go`).

That's it! You've successfully installed Go 1.22.3 on Ubuntu and configured the environment variables for Go development.
